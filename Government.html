    <p> It's no secret that society is not ideal. Violence and harmful crime is very frequent, examples being
      <br>
        murders, mass shootings, rape, severe physical and mental abuse, and acts of terrorism. It's true that
      <br>
        society tries to prevent this in different ways, from policing to justice and incarceration, to simply
      <br>
        trying to prevent bad things from happening in the first place. But what if all of that could be better?
      <br>
        This is what this research proposal intends to turn its focus on--what can be improved, and how will it 
      <br>
        help to create a better society than what we presently have? 
      <br><br>
        The general area I intend to study is that of governmental systems coupled with systems of justice and 
      <br>
        punishment. Along with this, I intend to study the intersection of those previous two, together
      <br>
        with mass surveillance to understand if a country with a certain outline for each of those various things
      <br>
      could work together effectively to create a more stable society with safer citizens who still have their 
      <br>
      liberties intact.
<br><br>
        This is an incredibly important topic as every one of the items listed directly affects the people. 
      <br>
      Government and governmental bodies, the justice system and incarceration, and internal protecting forces
      <br>
      such as the police all immediately and directly affect every individual living under a governmentâ€™s rule. If 
      <br>
      this could be done more effectively, it would be of great importance to every individual. More specifically, 
      <br>
      since I believe this could fall under the realm of philosophy, it would help to expand the knowledge base from 
      <br>
      which decisions could be made and it assists in progressing society further by encouraging discussion.
