    Significance & Conclusion

  <p>
    This is an area that is not delved into by most studies, as most studies are examining the 
    <br>
    bare ideas rather than their synthesis and broader application. Each of the individual ideas 
    <br>
    are important as the success of any one (or sometimes a pair) of ideas, if functional, would 
    <br>
    improve society in some part, however, if the batch of ideas could be successfully synthesized 
    <br>
    into a coherent, functional system, it would have massive impact on the discussion of how 
    <br>
    societies should or could be designed in the realm of political philosophy–especially as technology 
    <br>
    develops and we learn new things–and ways in which we could improve our own to better protect 
    <br>
    the many, many humans who have horrible things done to them by other humans. If there were to 
    <br>
    be a way that a country could protect or otherwise aid their citizens, the many individuals, 
    <br>
    without costing them their liberties, that would be incredibly beneficial to every nation which 
    <br>
    values its people–in essence, the entire world.
