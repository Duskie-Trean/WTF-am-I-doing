      The way I would collect data would primarily be through analysis of prior studies of the effectiveness of 
      <br>
      certain concepts in action, as well as works of political philosophy to examine the possibility of making 
      <br>
      specific changes to systems of governance, and personal testimony where applicable. 
      <br><br>
     

      The form of government and closely related things such as how to prevent corruption and how punishments 
      <br>
      would need to change with effective mass surveillance and prevention, would likely be purely in the realm 
      <br>
      of philosophy and philosophical works. The effectiveness of surveillance to maintain safety, and the effect 
      <br>
      of incarceration on the human psyche would be examined with scientific studies and personal testimonies. 
      <br>
      The possibility of mass data sifting and actionable mass surveillance would be done through an examination of 
      <br>
      the technologies available to humanity at this present time by looking at what is being used already. This 
      <br>
      method would be the most practical as it treats each idea in accordance with what data is available. There 
      <br>
      are few studies done on true aristocracies because there have been no aristocracies of this kindâ€“a similar 
      <br>
      thing goes for corruption and how punishments would have to change. When it comes to incarceration and the 
      <br>
      effectiveness of surveillance for a variety of different things, there are many studies, and likely even more 
      <br>
      personal testimonies when it comes to prisons. Data sifting and actionable mass surveillance merely requires a 
      <br>
      discussion of technological possibility which requires knowing our present technological capabilities. 
      <br>
      Examining each of these in such a way ensures the best information on each of them to understand how they 
      <br>
      could work together.
      
      <br><br>

      Once this had been done, further, but a more brief analysis, would be performed on how the ideas could work 
      <br>
      together, and if they would function well and maintain safety and liberty. This does not, however, lend 
      <br>
      itself well to a control.

      If the results show that, for each of the individual ideas, each has the potential to succeed (create a 
      <br>
      safer society without the cost of liberty) in their corresponding areas and that potential is greater than 
      <br>
      the chance of failure, then if the overarching schema appears to work together, it ought to be considered 
      <br>
      viable as a way to design or redesign society.
