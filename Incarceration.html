   <p>
     To be more specific about the questions I wish to answer:
    </p>
    
    <div class="list" id="list">
     <ol class="list">
      <li class="list">
        Is true mass surveillance and data sifting reasonably possible merely in terms of technology?
      </li>
       
      <li class="list">
        Can there be both actionable mass surveillance (acted on by an entity in the name of safety) and liberty?
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Is our incarceration system inadequate, and how should it change if so? 
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        How would a justice system change with mass surveillance?
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Is an aristocracy actually a feasible form of government, and what would make someone fit to rule?
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Can corruption and misuse of power be prevented in those individual systems?
      </li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div id="Paragraph">
<p>
    The ways in which each of these questions relate to that which was brought up in the introduction should be clear; 
    <br>
    if mass surveillance is not reasonably possible, then it could not create a better society. If it conflicts with 
    <br>
    liberty, then it is inadequate. If there is a better system of incarceration, then what we have needs to change; 
    <br>
    especially if mass surveillance changed the severity of punishment. If a system of rule could be better than what 
    <br>
    presently exists in terms of the ability to act, react, and remain stable, then it would be very beneficial to the 
    <br>
    people to switch to such a system. Finally, if corruption is not almost certainly preventable, then the government 
    <br>
    does not have the ability to remain stableâ€“as important as it is that the system works, it also needs to be stable, 
    <br>
    to be able to last and withstand a variety of things.
<br><br>
    
    If my hypotheses are confirmed, then there would be a significantly better society in virtually every measurable aspect. 
    <br>
    If my hypotheses are disconfirmed, then there may still be at least some concept of value in it, but not in its 
    <br>
    immediate application, and they would at the very least spark more debate about how to make improvements to societies. 
    <br>
    Regardless of whether or not the hypotheses are confirmed, society will be improved in the long term
