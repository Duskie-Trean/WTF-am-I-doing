        There is a lot of information in this area that could be utilized in a discussion of government, 
        <br>
        surveillance, justice, and protection. Surveillance comes in when it comes to protection–one cannot 
        <br>
        protect unless they have the knowledge of where to be, what to do, and who to protect. Surveillance 
        <br>
        is the means by which such knowledge is gained, as well as a preventative measure (such as Foucault’s 
        <br>
        analysis of Bentham’s panopticon). Following from that, if a hypothetical crime were prevented, the 
        <br>
        entire way that punishment is meted would need to be different as everything would be only attempted. 
        <br>
        More than that though, our present system of punishment and incarceration is inadequate for 
        <br>
        rehabilitation, and other countries such as Sweden have found an improved system. The government being
        <br>
        suitably changed would merely be something which could be a stabilising and improving force for the 
        <br>
        general wellbeing of its people, as I would argue, more or less along with Rousseau, that a democracy 
        <br>
        for a large society is inadequate, and that an aristocracy, in its literal sense of rule by the best 
        <br>
        (ruling by those who are most fit to rule) is among the best forms of government–the trickiest part 
        <br>
        would be ensuring standards for who can rule that are non-arbitrary and installing systems to prevent 
        <br>
        the untoward use of that power or other forms of corruption. 
        <br><br>

        Now the reason that I would dare to throw my voice into the mix is not because of the inadequacies of 
        <br>
        any of the studies or their thoughts, but because there is a unique synthesis that I believe presents 
        <br>
        itself from the combination of these ideas that would create a more stable, safer, more efficient, and 
        <br>
        freer environment in which to exist. Previous studies do not reach far enough, but they were not meant 
        <br>
        to–neither are the moral issues from scaling the concepts up and combining them dealt with in the various 
        <br>
        sources of information. Using those studies, ideas, and testimonies as a launching pad for each of the 
        <br>
        individual ideas, and synthesizing them with a few independent ideas, I believe a more ideal country and 
        <br>
        society could exist.
