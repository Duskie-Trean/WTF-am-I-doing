      It's no secret that society is not ideal. Violence and harmful crime is very frequent, examples being 
      <br>
      murders, mass shootings, rape, severe physical and mental abuse, and acts of terrorism. It's true that
      <br>
      society tries to prevent this in different ways, from policing to justice and incarceration, to simply
      <br>
      trying to prevent bad things from happening in the first place. But what if all of that could be better?
      <br>
      This is what this article intends to turn its focus on--what can be improved, and how will it help to
      <br>
      create a better society than what we presently have?
